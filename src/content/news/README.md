# Adding news

Adding news is similar to adding content pages.

1. Open `content/news/news-directory` and copy one of the item to the top of the array.
2. For short news update, you can omit `url` property. In this case, only summary will be visible and there will be no 'Read Full Article' link.
3. If you want to author a full article, create an md file in the `news` folder and link it in `news-directory.ts`.
