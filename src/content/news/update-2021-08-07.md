The TruePool pooling community just got a bit more awesome as the following updates went live in the past week:

- Website Header bar with quick stats and XCH -> USD Exchange rate information
- Full Payout Reports for each won block - [Example](https://truepool.io/payout/8)
- Updated [Docker Images](https://truepool.io/kb/truepool-docker-image), which now include the [PlotNG](https://github.com/maded2/plotng) utility for mega and small farmers alike
- The [Machinaris](https://www.machinaris.app/) application was [ported](https://github.com/truenas/charts/pull/109) to [TrueNAS SCALE](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/), for farmers who prefer point-n-clicky web-driven interfaces.

More changes are in the works that will keep making TruePool the best place for all your Chia farming needs. If you haven't already, join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hWwAfGFyBz), where we have a very lively group Farmers and Operators to help you on your journey.
